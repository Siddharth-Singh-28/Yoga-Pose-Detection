# Yoga-Pose-Detection
A Flask-based web application that detects yoga poses in real time using your webcam. It uses MediaPipe to extract body landmarks and classifies poses with a custom-trained ensemble ML model (VotingClassifier using Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest). The system also displays the predicted pose and confidence score on the live feed.
